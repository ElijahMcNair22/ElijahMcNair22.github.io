<p1>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. </p1>
<p2>I felt deeply moved, and stirred.It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </p2>
<p3>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </p3>
<p4>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: </p4>
<p5>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...”</p5>
<p6>As his lips opened slowly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: </p6>
<p7>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." </p7>
<p8>And I felt him to be more fragile still. </p8>
<p9>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</p9>
